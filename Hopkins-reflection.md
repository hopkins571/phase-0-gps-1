# GPS 1.1 Reflection

Before this GPS, I hadn't yet gotten the opportunity to work with others in Github and practice cloning repositories and creating pull requests in other people's repos. Before the GPS, I wasn't sure if I understood it, and having the opportunity to practice it confirmed I'd figured it out. This GPS clarified for me how Github works.

Hanah was very helpful and answered my questions about what happens when you make git mistakes. I asked her what happens when you forget to commit in one branch and then begin working in another. That showed me just how important it is to ABC - always be committing - and to always be aware of which branch is open! My pair, Gregory, and I both spent a lot of time asking one another about and sharing best practices we'd figured out.

I think I have a good understanding of Git. The one thing that still confuses me are merge conflicts. I'm not sure how to resolve them once they arise. 

This was not only my first GPS, but my first experience pairing altogether. It was a really positive experience. I'll admit I felt a little awkward at the beginning, but that went away right away. Working with Gregory was great, and Hanah gave us some helpful guidance.
