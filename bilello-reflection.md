GPS 1.1 Reflection

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was having a difficult time understanding the basic concept of Git.  The idea behind the software felt very foreign for me, even as an individual growing up around computers with a high level of comfort navigating through files and folders using a command line interface.  I was also having a hard time understanding exactly how Git and GitHub worked together to manage version control of a project.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Understanding how and when to switch branches in a project, and simply gaining mor experience in working with Git and GitHub helped tremendously in my understanding of how all the systems worked.  It was very helpful seeing someone else work through their own command line, as it gave me insight into the thought process of someone else and how they approached a specific problem in their own way.  Our guide also cleared up some questions about merge conflicts and how they come about, and how to avoid them.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I had trouble remembering the syntax for markdown files, so my pair was very helpful in recalling those concepts while we worked together.  We also asked questions of our guide about merge conflicts.

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm honestly not very confused about using Git at this point.  I feel that there are definitely concepts that I'm not familiar with, as I haven't encountered them, but I feel confident enough in my own abilities to learn and understand those concepts when/if they arise.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was fantastic!  I felt comfortable working together, and was thankful to not only have another student to share ideas with, but to have a guide to help us if we were to get stuck, which fortunately didn't happen that often.  I also felt that having immediate feedback was incredibly valuable.  All in all, it was a great experience.
